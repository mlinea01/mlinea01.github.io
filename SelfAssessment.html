  &emsp;&emsp;My time throughout my degree program was very rewarding and informative as to the skills needed to be successful in the field of software development.  I have 
  learned many skills from object-oriented programming, to how to operate in an agile team environment, and how to communicate these ideas to an individual who does not have a 
  technical background.  The programming aspects of my program were amazing and taught me the proper ways to write code in an organized manner utilizing programming best 
  practices.  The object-oriented approach to my programming skills is an important aspect of my skills that I will be able to bring with me into my professional career.  I have 
  become aware of the proper data structures to be used in a given situation such as lists, maps, and arrays, among many others.  There are so many data structures and algorithms
  that can be used, and I have become very familiar with many sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, quick sort, selection sort, etc.  The great part about software development 
  is that it is an ever-changing field, I understand I won’t have the ability to memorize every aspect of a specific language, but I will have the skills to adapt and learn as I 
  progress throughout my career.  Another important aspect of programming that I have learned is the security side of writing code.  Running unit tests, among other testing 
  methods, to not only look at if the program is running as intended but looking to see if there is any way I could break the program.  These bugs are potential security risks 
  and identifying those security risks is a skill I’ve learned to use when writing code and an important skill to utilize throughout my career.  Aside of the programming aspects 
  of my curriculum, I have learned other useful skills such as working with a team in an agile team environment.  I’ve obtained knowledge on communicating with the scrum master, 
  product owner, and my team on a daily basis to ensure work is completed correctly, and in a timely manner.  These skills have even taught me ways to communicate ideas to 
  partners of the company that do not have a technical background.  Through the use of User Stories, Entity-Relationship diagrams, use-case diagrams, and class diagrams, to name 
  a few, I can affectively break down a project into basic elements that can be communicated to others who do not understand the technical aspects of the project.  I feel that 
  with a combination of the object-oriented programming skills I’ve obtained, paired with the team environment communication skills, I would be a valuable asset to a software 
  development team.

  &emsp;&emsp;The artifact shown on this page is a basic student management system program.  This program will introduce you to some of the skills that I have obtained throughout 
  my program.  The program utilizes an object-oriented programming approach as well as different data structures and algorithms to showcase a few skills that I have obtained.  
  You will notice the programming best practices such as descriptive names for variables and functions, comments to explain my code, the proper use of data structures and 
  algorithms, as well as organizing the data through the use of an SQL database.  This program won’t cover every aspect that I will be able to bring to the table, but it will 
  outline some of the important skills that I feel will make me an excellent programmer.  The main idea behind this page is to showcase a few skills that I will be able to bring 
  with me into my career, software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases.  The student management system will properly showcase my skills in those 
  three categories and give you an idea of where my skills are as a programmer.  The code review and narratives showcased on this page are geared toward the creation of this 
  program, the planned enhancements, and the implementation of those enhancements.  As you will see when you go through the video explanation, and each narrative, everything will 
  be explained in greater detail so that you will further understand my ideas behind those changes and the code that I have written.
